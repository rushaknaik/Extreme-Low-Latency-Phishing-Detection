# Extreme-Low-Latency-Phishing-Detection
This project presents an ultra-low-latency phishing URL detection system using a stacked ensemble of LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost models. Leveraging only lexical and statistical URL features, it achieves 95.9% accuracy with microsecond inference time, enabling real-time, scalable, and privacy-preserving cybersecurity deployment.
